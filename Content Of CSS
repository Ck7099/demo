    <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to control the presentation of HTML elements on a webpage. It defines how elements should appear, including their layout, colors, fonts, spacing, and animations.  

        Main Contents of CSS:
        
        1. Selectors  
           These target specific HTML elements to apply styles. Selectors can be based on element names, class names, IDs, or attributes.  
        
        2. Properties and Values 
           Every CSS rule consists of properties (such as color, font-size, and margin) and values (such as red, 16px, or auto) that define the appearance of an element.  
        
        3. Types of CSS 
           CSS can be written in different ways:  
           - Inline CSS, directly within an HTML element.  
           - Internal CSS, within a `<style>` tag inside the HTML `<head>`.  
           - External CSS, in a separate file linked to the HTML document.  
        
        4. Box Model  
           This concept defines how elements are displayed with respect to spacing. It includes content, padding, border, and margin, which determine the overall size and positioning of an element.  
        
        5. Positioning and Layout  
           CSS provides different ways to position elements, such as static, relative, absolute, fixed, and sticky positioning. Additionally, layout techniques like Flexbox and Grid help in organizing content efficiently.  
        
        6. Responsive Design  
           CSS allows web pages to adapt to different screen sizes using media queries. This ensures a website looks good on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.  
        
        7. Animations and Transitions  
           CSS enables smooth animations and transitions to enhance user experience by gradually changing element properties like color, size, or position.
